The folowing NPM modules are required:

- `readline-sync`

Install Node.js if you haven't already, `npm` comes with the installation of Node.js.

Run `npm i twitter readline-sync` to install the above modules. This installs the modules to the **current working directory** so run this inside the folder that has the code.

## Running the program

Run `node index.js` and enter the Twitter handle of the user you want to fetch.
